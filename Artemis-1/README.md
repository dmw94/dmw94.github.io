Made this in advance of the Artemis I launch because I don't seem to be able to find good dashboards / virtual situation rooms to track multiple feeds during big news events. 

Currently waiting for AROW to be released for real-time telemetry and tracking of the Orion spacecraft. Should be released the day before launch window opens.

Once the launch has happened, will need to replace the launch live feed with something else - possibly NASA TV live?

The formatting of the webpage is not pleasant (whitespace surrounding inconsistently dark formatted embeddings), but it'll do for the moment.
